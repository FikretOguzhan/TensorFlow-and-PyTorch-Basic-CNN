## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library used for developing artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Developed by Facebook, PyTorch offers a flexible and dynamic computation graph structure. It provides researchers and developers with the flexibility to easily make changes during model development and training. PyTorch is widely used in industry and research fields, supported by a large community.

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library developed by Google. It is widely used and follows a static computation graph structure. TensorFlow includes many pre-trained models, making it particularly suitable for large-scale machine learning projects. TensorFlow has become an industry standard and has a broad community that supports its use on various platforms, especially mobile and embedded devices.

## What is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)?

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a powerful deep learning architecture, especially designed for image recognition tasks. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, CNNs have a specialized architecture. They are primarily used for feature extraction and classification.

CNNs consist of consecutive convolution and pooling layers. Convolution layers use filters to extract feature maps from input data. Pooling layers summarize and reduce the dimensions of feature maps. Fully connected layers then use the features from the feature maps for classification.

## How to Create a CNN and its Purpose?

The general steps for creating a CNN include:

Data Preparation: Prepare training and test data.

Defining Model Architecture: Determine the CNN architecture, including elements like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Compiling the Model: Compile the model by specifying the optimization algorithm, loss function, and metrics.

Training: Train the model on training data and evaluate its performance based on defined metrics.

Evaluation and Prediction: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and make predictions on real-world data.

CNNs are commonly used for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and classification. They are particularly successful in computer vision systems and automation applications.
